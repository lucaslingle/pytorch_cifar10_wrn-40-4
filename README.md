Reproducing Zagoruyko and Komodakis, 2016 - 'Wide Residual Networks'. This code reproduces the CIFAR-10 experiment given in Table 5, using WRN-40-4.

The code takes about 6 hours to run on an NVIDIA V100 GPU. I recommend the Deep Learning VM on Google Compute Engine, which costs about $2.48/hr.
The total cost is about $15.00 to reproduce the experiment.
